# My Personal Project Repository

Welcome to my personal project repository! Here, I showcase my skills and growth as a developer by working on various small and big projects that inspire me. This repository serves as a portfolio of my work and demonstrates my passion for coding and learning new technologies.

## 🌟 Projects

Here's a list of projects I've worked on:

1. **Book in library mgmt**
   - Description: This is a book management app that is similar to a task manager app. It helps users keep track of their reading progress or completed books. I was inspired to create this project when I came across the Odin Project. I found this project and thought it would be a great way to learn about CRUD operations, especially for beginners.
   - Technologies used: Used HTML, CSS, and JS. Utilize Chrome local storage to retain data.
